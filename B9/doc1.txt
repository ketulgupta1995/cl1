A FIFO special file a named pipe is similar to a pipe, except that it is accessed as part of the filesystem. It can be opened  by  multiple processes for reading or writing. When processes are exchanging data via the FIFO, the kernel passes all data internally without writing it to the filesystem. Thus, the FIFO special file has no contents on the filesystem; the filesystem entry merely serves as a reference point so that processes can access the pipe using a name in the filesystem.
